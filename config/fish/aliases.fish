# Fish shell aliases
#
# NOTE: Most aliases have been moved to standalone function files
# in the functions/ directory, organized by category:
#
# - editor/      - Editor-related functions (e.fish, v.fish, etc.)
# - fs/          - Filesystem operations (mkd.fish, rmrf.fish, etc.)
# - git/         - Git operations
# - homebrew/    - Homebrew operations
# - kubernetes/  - Kubernetes operations
# - modern-cli/  - Modern CLI replacement tools (ls.fish, cat.fish, etc.)
# - navigation/  - Directory navigation
# - utils/       - Utility functions
#
# This file is kept for backwards compatibility and historical reference.
# New aliases should be added as standalone function files.

# Helper function command_exists is now in functions/utils/command_exists.fish

# To see all available abbreviations:
# abbr -l
#
# To see all available functions:
# functions -n | sort

# Legacy abbreviation definitions below - these will be removed in the future
# as they are all now implemented as functions.
#
# See the functions directory for the current implementations.
