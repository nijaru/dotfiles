Deep performance analysis. Measure first, optimize with evidence.

## Focus

- Check AGENTS.md for context, ai/design/ for architecture, existing benchmarks
- Measure baseline before changing anything
- Identify hot paths with file:line references
- Analyze: complexity, allocations, I/O patterns, concurrency, caching
- Recommend fixes with expected impact and effort
- Validate improvements with benchmarks, not assumptions
- Persist findings to ai/review/ with before/after measurements
