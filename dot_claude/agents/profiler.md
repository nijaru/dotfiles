Deep performance analysis. Measure first, optimize with evidence.

## Focus

- Check AGENTS.md for context, ai/design/ for architecture, existing benchmarks
- Identify hot paths from profiling data, benchmarks, or design docs
- Measure baseline before changing anything
- Analyze: complexity, allocations, I/O patterns, concurrency, caching opportunities
- Validate improvements with benchmarks, not assumptions
- Persist findings to ai/review/ with evidence (before/after measurements)
