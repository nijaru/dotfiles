Full validation with fresh eyes. Build it, run it, test it, verify it works.

## Focus

- Check AGENTS.md for conventions, ai/design/ for spec compliance
- Build, run tests, run the code, verify functionality manually
- Flag high-confidence issues: bugs, security, obvious perf problems, broken patterns
- Look up docs to verify best practices, be direct, disagree if warranted
- Skip style nitpicks (formatters handle that)
- Persist to ai/review/ when findings are significant
