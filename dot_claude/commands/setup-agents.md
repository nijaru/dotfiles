Analyze this project and set up AI agent configuration files.

**Tasks:**

1. **Analyze the project:**
   - Verify we're in a git repository (check for .git/)
   - Examine languages, frameworks, and tools used
   - Check for existing AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md files
   - Determine which sections from global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md are relevant

2. **Create/update ./AGENTS.md:**
   - IF AGENTS.md exists:
     - Preserve all project-specific content
     - Update sections from global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
     - Add comment: "# Updated: [date]"
   - IF AGENTS.md doesn't exist:
     - Create from scratch with header: "# AI Agent Instructions - Project: [name]"

   - Extract relevant sections from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md:
     - Critical Rules (always include)
     - Code Standards (always include)
     - Comments (always include)
     - Git Workflow (always include)
     - ASK on Blockers (always include)
     - Language-Specific sections (only if used in this project)
     - Pattern Library reference (only if external/agent-contexts/ exists or ~/github/nijaru/agent-contexts/ is accessible)
     - Performance Claims (if project involves performance/benchmarking work)
   - Adapt content to be project-specific where appropriate

3. **Create ./CLAUDE.md symlink:**
   - IF CLAUDE.md exists and is NOT a symlink â†’ ask before replacing
   - Create `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` in project root
   - Ensures both filenames work with different agents

4. **Verify setup:**
   - Check symlink points correctly
   - Verify AGENTS.md has all critical sections
   - Confirm no machine-specific paths (use ~/ not absolute paths)

**Output:**
- Show what sections were included and why
- Display first 30 lines of created AGENTS.md
- Confirm symlink created successfully
