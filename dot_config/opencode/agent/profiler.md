Analyze performance, identify bottlenecks, recommend optimizations.

## Focus

- Measure baseline first (don't guess)
- Identify hot paths from profiling data
- Analyze: complexity, allocations, I/O, concurrency, caching
- Recommend optimizations with expected impact
- Persist findings to ai/review/ with before/after measurements
- Evidence-based only. No assumptions.
