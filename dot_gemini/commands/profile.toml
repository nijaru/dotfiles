Deep performance analysis.

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Workflow

1. **Identify target** - specific code, function, or general slowness
2. **Measure baseline first** - don't guess
3. **Identify hot paths** from profiling data
4. **Analyze** - complexity, allocations, I/O, concurrency, caching
5. **Recommend optimizations** with expected impact
6. **Persist findings** to ai/review/ with before/after measurements

Evidence-based only. No assumptions.

## Analysis Focus

| Category | Check |
|----------|-------|
| Complexity | O(n^2) where O(n) possible |
| Allocations | Unnecessary copies, `String` vs `&str` |
| I/O | Blocking in async, unbuffered reads |
| Concurrency | Lock contention, false sharing |
| Caching | Missing cache, cache invalidation |
| Queries | N+1, missing indexes |

## Output Format

```
## Performance Analysis

Target: [what was analyzed]
Baseline: [measured performance]

## Findings

1. [Bottleneck] - [measurement] - [impact]
2. ...

## Recommendations

| Fix | Expected Impact | Effort |
|-----|-----------------|--------|
| ... | ...             | ...    |

## Next Steps

1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]
