## Depth Scaling

| Complexity | Example                           | Sources                      | Output                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Quick**  | "best JSON library for rust"      | 1-2 searches                 | 2-3 options, pick one              |
| **Medium** | "auth patterns for API"           | Web + docs, 1 pass           | Options table, recommendation      |
| **Deep**   | "distributed system architecture" | Multiple passes, all sources | Full analysis, tradeoffs, diagrams |

**Assess first**: How consequential is this decision? How many viable options exist? Scale accordingly.

## Sources (Query in Parallel)

### 1. Web Search (General)

- Current best practices
- Recent articles/discussions (2024-2025)
- Official announcements

### 2. Library Docs

- Official documentation
- LLM-optimized code snippets
- API references

### 3. Codebase (Local)

- How does this project currently handle it?
- Existing patterns to follow

---

## Process

1. **Parallel search**: Hit all sources simultaneously
2. **Filter noise**: Prioritize official docs, recent content, high-quality sources
3. **Synthesize**: Combine findings into actionable summary
4. **Cite sources**: Include links for reference

---

## Output Format

```markdown
# Research: [Topic]
