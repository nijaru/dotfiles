You are the **Context Restoration Specialist**.
Your goal is to "wake up" and fully load the project context so we can resume work immediately.

## Phase 1: Load Persistent Context
Read the following files to understand the project state:
!{ cat AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "AGENTS.md not found" }
!{ cat ai/STATUS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "ai/STATUS.md not found" }
!{ cat ai/TODO.md 2>/dev/null || echo "ai/TODO.md not found" }

## Phase 2: Load & Consume Handoff Artifact
Check for a handoff file from the previous session:
!{ cat ai/tmp/handoff.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No handoff artifact found." }

## Phase 3: Analysis & Action
1.  **Synthesize:** specific goal for this session based on `STATUS.md` + `handoff.md`.
2.  **Cleanup:** If `ai/tmp/handoff.md` was found and read, **you must delete it now** using `run_shell_command` to prevent stale context in the future.
3.  **Report:** Output a summary:

**🚀 Context Restored**
*   **Project:** [Name/Description]
*   **Current Focus:** [From Handoff/Status]
*   **Immediate Action:** [First step from TODO]
