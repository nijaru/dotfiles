Break project specs into sprints and atomic tasks.

## Input

User provides spec file path: @docs/spec.md, @DESIGN.md, etc.

## Process

### 1. Analyze the Spec

Read the spec thoroughly. Identify:
- Core features and requirements
- Dependencies between components
- Technical risks and unknowns
- Integration points

### 2. Break Into Sprints

Each sprint must result in **demoable software** that:
- Can be run and tested independently
- Builds on previous sprints
- Delivers visible progress

### 3. Define Atomic Tasks

Every task must be:
- **Atomic**: Single commit, single concern
- **Testable**: Has tests OR clear validation criteria
- **Independent**: Can be worked on without blocking others (where possible)
- **Clear**: Technical enough that implementation path is obvious

### 4. Task Format

```markdown
## Task: [Short descriptive title]

**Sprint:** N
**Depends on:** [task IDs or "none"]

### Description
[What needs to be built/changed]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable criterion]
- [ ] [Tests pass / validation method]

### Technical Notes
[Implementation hints, gotchas, relevant code paths]
```

### 5. Review

After drafting, ask yourself:
- Missing edge cases or requirements from the spec?
- Tasks too large (should be split)?
- Tasks too small (should be combined)?
- Unclear acceptance criteria?
- Missing dependencies?
- Sprint goals that aren't demoable?

### 6. Output

Write to ai/SPRINTS.md:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan: [Project Name]

Source: [spec file path]
Generated: [date]

## Sprint 1: [Goal - what's demoable]

### Tasks
- [ ] TASK-1: ...
- [ ] TASK-2: ...

## Sprint 2: [Goal]
...
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Tasks too vague ("implement auth") | Be specific ("add JWT middleware to /api routes") |
| No validation criteria | Every task needs tests or explicit verification |
| Sprints aren't demoable | Each sprint = working software, not just "backend done" |
| Missing dependencies | Map what blocks what before finalizing order |
