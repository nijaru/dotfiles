Break project specs into sprints and atomic tasks.

## Input

User provides spec file path: @docs/spec.md, @DESIGN.md, etc.

## Process

### 1. Analyze the Spec

Read the spec thoroughly. Identify:
- Core features and requirements
- Dependencies between components
- Technical risks and unknowns
- Integration points

### 2. Break Into Sprints

Each sprint must result in **demoable software** that:
- Can be run and tested independently
- Builds on previous sprints
- Delivers visible progress

### 3. Define Atomic Tasks

Every task must be:
- **Atomic**: Single commit, single concern
- **Testable**: Has tests OR clear validation criteria
- **Independent**: Can be worked on without blocking others (where possible)
- **Clear**: Technical enough that implementation path is obvious

### 4. Task Format

```markdown
## Task: [Short descriptive title]

**Depends on:** [task IDs or "none"]

### Description
[What needs to be built/changed]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable criterion]
- [ ] [Tests pass / validation method]

### Technical Notes
[Implementation hints, gotchas, relevant code paths]
```

### 5. Review

After drafting, ask yourself:
- Missing edge cases or requirements from the spec?
- Tasks too large (should be split)?
- Tasks too small (should be combined)?
- Unclear acceptance criteria?
- Missing dependencies?
- Sprint goals that aren't demoable?

### 6. Output Structure

Create two things:

**Index file** ai/SPRINTS.md:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan: [Project Name]

Source: [spec file path]
Generated: [date]

| Sprint | Goal | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| [01-auth](sprints/01-auth.md) | User authentication | active |
| [02-api](sprints/02-api.md) | Core API endpoints | pending |
```

**Individual sprint files** ai/sprints/NN-name.md:

```markdown
# Sprint 01: Auth

Goal: User authentication working end-to-end

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add JWT middleware

**Depends on:** none

**Description:** Add JWT validation middleware to /api routes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Middleware rejects invalid tokens
- [ ] Middleware extracts user ID
- [ ] Tests pass
```

### 7. Updating Sprints

When a sprint completes:
1. Update status in ai/SPRINTS.md index
2. Mark tasks complete in the sprint file
3. Set next sprint to active

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Tasks too vague ("implement auth") | Be specific ("add JWT middleware to /api routes") |
| No validation criteria | Every task needs tests or explicit verification |
| Sprints aren't demoable | Each sprint = working software, not just "backend done" |
| Missing dependencies | Map what blocks what before finalizing order |
